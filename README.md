# Basic-Python-Data-Visualizations

Creates different types of plots (bar, scatter, line, pie) using matplotlib and numpy. Includes reading data from files and displaying multiple subplots to visualize various datasets.

## Features

- Bar graphs, scatter plots, line graphs, and pie charts  
- Reads numerical data from external text files  
- Validates matching list lengths for plotting  
- Organizes multiple plots in a 2x2 grid layout  
- Clear labeling and titles on all plots

## How It Works

- Defines reusable functions for each plot type  
- Reads numeric data from a text file for line graphs  
- Creates a 2x2 subplot grid to display all charts together  
- Uses lists of data points for colors, values, years, and population percentages  
- Shows all plots in a single window
